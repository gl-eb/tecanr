    These functions use `readxl::read_xlsx()` to import data from Excel files
    and then wrangle it into
    [tidy format](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)
    for downstream plotting and analysis. You will want to use one of these
    functions in most cases.

    These functions are what higher-level functions such as `tecan_parse()` use
    to convert the output of `readxl::read_xlsx()` into
    [tidy format](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html). These functions for more specific use cases where the data type is known and side
    effects of the higher-level functions are unwanted. The example data set
    is mostly useful for debugging and understanding the inner workings of these
    functions.
